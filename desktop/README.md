# LazyMind Desktop

Desktop mode wraps the existing host-process Local runtime in an Electron shell. Local remains a source-checkout runtime; Desktop is the distributable form.

## Build matrix

| Platform | Local | Desktop |
|----------|-------|---------|
| macOS Intel x64 | `make local-up` / `make local-down` | `make desktop-darwin-x64` / `make desktop-darwin-x64-dmg` (native Intel validation pending) |
| macOS arm64 | `make local-up` / `make local-down` | `make desktop-darwin-arm64` (internal ZIP) / `make desktop-darwin-arm64-dmg` (signed DMG) |
| Windows x64 | `make local-win-up` / `make local-win-down` | `make desktop-windows-x64` (portable ZIP) / `make desktop-windows-x64-installer` (installer) |

Desktop packages bundle the Go services, process-compose, Caddy, the compiled frontend, Python 3.11 runtime, auth/algorithm venvs, LazyLLM, and shared Local dependencies. Default builds provide RAG/Milvus dependencies as a separately installable component and fetch published workflow examples during warmup. Model weights are not bundled.

Release history samples remain separate ModelScope ZIP assets, described by `desktop/history-injection-package.json`. By default, Windows/macOS builds stage only their URL, size and SHA-256 into the runtime manifest. Installer/first-launch warmup downloads and verifies the archive after Python preparation, caches it under the user runtime, extracts its `history-injection/` subtree, and then starts Core to import conversations and artifacts. Matching installed samples are reused without network access. Download failures preserve existing samples, allow normal startup and retry at the next runtime launch. The signed application directory is never modified. Set `LAZYMIND_DESKTOP_DEFER_HISTORY=false` (Actions: `defer_history=false`) to restore the bundled archive for offline distribution; publishing the sample ZIP and updating its metadata remains unchanged.

## Fast Desktop development

To verify a slim Python environment and its downloaded RAG bundle without building an installer, run `scripts/verify-python-components.py` with the staged algorithm Python. It checks base imports, ZIP integrity, overlay imports, and Milvus persistence across a restart using temporary data. Commands, current platform results and coverage limits are in [the package-size development notes](../docs/development/desktop-package-size-reduction.md#不打安装包先在本机复测).

Use the source Electron shell for browser/UI development instead of rebuilding an installer:

```bash
make local-up
make desktop-dev
```

`desktop-dev` starts a Desktop-mode Vite renderer on `127.0.0.1:5173`, proxies API and Browser WebSocket traffic to the existing Local Runtime on `127.0.0.1:8090`, and launches Electron directly from `desktop/electron`. React/CSS changes use Vite HMR. Changes to `desktop/electron/src/*.js` automatically restart only Electron.

Stop the development shell without stopping Local Runtime:

```bash
make desktop-dev-down
```

Logs are written under `local/build/desktop-dev/`. Override the defaults with `LAZYMIND_DESKTOP_DEV_PORT` and `LAZYMIND_DESKTOP_EXTERNAL_RUNTIME_URL`. Both renderer and runtime URLs are restricted to loopback hosts because the renderer receives the privileged Desktop preload bridge. Browser actions default to the Chromium engine already included in Electron. Users can also select their installed Microsoft Edge under Settings → System tools → Dependencies → LazyMind Browser. Desktop connects automatically and opens dedicated windows with persistent website sessions; no Chrome/Edge extension setup is required. Edge uses a separate profile and a private CDP pipe, with no additional runtime dependency or browser download. Docker and Local can still use the external Chrome/Edge extension.

Run the dedicated browser connection and adapter tests with `node --test desktop/electron/tests/*.test.js` from the repository root.

Platform-maintained Skill directories and installable Skill links are declared together in `skills/builtin-sources.yaml`; curated experiences keep their schema, locales, and images under `skills/featured/<id>/`. Desktop builds package or download every source into the same locked ZIP catalog under `resources/runtime/builtin-skills`, and compile the curated catalog plus content-hashed assets under `resources/runtime/featured-skills`. Bundled Caddy serves those assets through `/showcase-assets/` on both macOS and Windows. Release builds use the lock in frozen mode; users only unpack a Skill into their personal revision store when they click Install or Try.

The frontend dependency tree is installed while building, but raw `frontend/node_modules` is not distributed. Vite compiles browser dependencies into `frontend/dist`, and Desktop serves that static output through bundled Caddy.

## Outputs

macOS:

```text
desktop/dist/mac-arm64/LazyMind.app
desktop/dist/LazyMind-darwin-arm64.zip
desktop/dist/LazyMind-macos-arm64.dmg
```

Windows:

```text
desktop/dist/win-unpacked/             # complete unpacked Electron application
desktop/dist/LazyMind-windows-x64-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss-<commit>.zip  # portable distribution with build time and short Git commit
desktop/dist/LazyMind-windows-x64-installer-<version>-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss-<commit>.exe  # assisted per-user installer
```

`LazyMind.exe` is the entry point inside `win-unpacked`; the directory also contains Electron DLLs/locales and `resources/runtime` with all LazyMind services and Python dependencies.

The Feishu CLI version and platform archive/license checksums are maintained together in `backend/core/providerconnection/feishu-cli-release.json`. macOS, Windows, Docker, and the Go runtime read this same manifest; update the version and its checksums together when upgrading the CLI.

## Cloud release origin

Set `LAZYMIND_CLOUD_BASE_URL` while building a Desktop package to embed its trusted Cloud HTTPS origin in `resources/runtime/manifest.json`:

```bash
LAZYMIND_CLOUD_BASE_URL=https://cloud.example.com make desktop-darwin-arm64
```

The value must be an HTTPS origin without a path, query, fragment, or user information. A packaged Desktop uses the embedded Manifest value and does not allow a process environment variable to replace it. Source development remains configurable through `LAZYMIND_CLOUD_BASE_URL`; omitting the variable while building produces a Local-only package without Cloud navigation.

An internal test package can forward the fixed Notion OAuth callback from `https://localhost:8443` to its embedded Cloud origin without an SSH tunnel:

```bash
LAZYMIND_DESKTOP_BUILD_AUDIENCE=internal \
LAZYMIND_CLOUD_BASE_URL=https://cloud.internal.example:5027 \
LAZYMIND_CLOUD_OAUTH_CALLBACK_MODE=localhost-relay \
LAZYMIND_CLOUD_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT=8443 \
make desktop-darwin-arm64
```

The relay starts lazily when the user begins managed Provider OAuth, so a port conflict cannot prevent Desktop or its local features from starting. It is a byte-only TCP forwarder bound to `127.0.0.1`; TLS remains end-to-end between the browser and Cloud. The test Cloud certificate therefore needs both its configured Cloud hostname and `DNS:localhost` SANs, and every test device must trust only the corresponding lab CA certificate. The CA private key is never packaged. Production is the default build audience and fails closed if `localhost-relay` is requested; production packages use `direct` with the final Cloud HTTPS domain.

## macOS signed DMG

The local distribution build requires a `Developer ID Application` identity in
the login keychain:

```bash
make desktop-darwin-arm64-dmg
```

`electron-builder` discovers the local Developer ID identity automatically.
The local target signs the app and DMG but does not submit them to Apple.

Official tag builds in `LazyAGI/LazyMind` require CI signing and notarization
credentials. `.github/workflows/macos-installer.yml` maps them from
`MAC_CSC_LINK`, `MAC_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`,
`APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` environment secrets. They
submit a ZIP first, staple the accepted app ticket, then package, submit, and
staple the DMG. Either notarization stage fails after its bounded timeout.

Tag builds in forks do not read these secrets or use a Developer ID identity.
They apply only the ad-hoc signature required by the packaged arm64 application,
skip Apple notarization, and publish an explicitly unnotarized DMG for testing.

Desktop release tags containing a prerelease suffix, such as `v0.3.0-a0` or
`v0.3.0-rc.1`, run the complete platform build and installer test workflows but
do not create a GitHub Release. Stable tags such as `v0.3.0` create a draft
GitHub Release after both platforms pass.

A DMG drag-install cannot run a post-install script. To provide the same cache
and runtime preparation as the Windows NSIS installer, the packaged macOS app
runs the shared offline installer warmup once on first launch for each app
version. A failed warmup is not marked complete and is retried on the next
launch.

Windows Desktop supports Windows 10/11 x64, runs as the current user, and does not require MinGW, administrator rights, or Developer Mode. Installer builds are unsigned unless standard electron-builder signing variables such as `CSC_LINK` are supplied.

The assisted installer supports in-place upgrades and blocks downgrades. It offers two installation types:

- **Simple installation (default):** installs the bundled Python environment as a single archive, avoiding installation-time expansion and the long per-file firewall/antivirus scan. Python is expanded automatically on first launch.
- **Full installation:** expands Python and warms the bundled Python, Node, and local services before setup completes, matching the previous installer behavior.

Silent installs default to simple mode and accept `--simple-install` or `--full-install` explicitly. On a fresh or repair install, existing `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LazyMind` data can be retained (the default) or cleared. Upgrades always retain it. The uninstaller similarly defaults to removing the program only and can optionally clear Local AppData. Neither workflow reads, deletes, or moves `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\LazyMind`.

## Trusted local mode

Desktop packages restrict agent file writes to the per-conversation workspace and disable local command tools by default. For a trusted, single-user package, set `LAZYMIND_TRUSTED_LOCAL_MODE=true` when building:

```powershell
$env:LAZYMIND_TRUSTED_LOCAL_MODE = 'true'
make desktop-windows-x64-installer
```

The build records the feature in the packaged runtime manifest, so the installed app keeps the setting without requiring the user to configure an environment variable. In this mode, agents may read and write user-requested absolute host paths and can use LazyLLM's local command tool. Existing overwrite, delete, move, and dangerous-command approval checks still apply. Do not enable this mode in packages distributed to untrusted or multi-user environments.

For source-based Local runs, setting the same environment variable before `make local-win-up` or `make local-up` enables the mode for that process without changing a desktop package.

## Runtime behavior

Desktop binds only to `127.0.0.1`. It retains the normal Local/Desktop auto-login flow through `/_local/admin-session`, while LAN auto-login remains disabled.

Local and Desktop share the platform LazyMind data directory so knowledge bases remain available when switching modes, but they cannot run concurrently. Stop Local before opening Desktop and close Desktop before starting Local. Electron also enforces a single Desktop instance.

On Windows, all Desktop-generated files live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LazyMind`:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\LazyMind\data             # SQLite, Milvus, uploads, and service data
%LOCALAPPDATA%\LazyMind\Desktop          # Electron/Chromium profile and browser caches
%LOCALAPPDATA%\LazyMind\Logs\desktop     # Electron startup and diagnostic logs
%LOCALAPPDATA%\LazyMind\Logs\crash-dumps # Electron crash reports
```

Desktop does not read, migrate, or remove any legacy Electron profile outside this root. The Windows local document source is `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\LazyMind`; Desktop creates it at runtime startup and the file watcher scans it recursively.

Local-folder discovery asks for consent before each parent-location selection and keeps broad search locations in Electron's profile only. Discovery uses a bounded, directory-only scan, skips the platform Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and media folders, and does not pass broad locations to the local runtime. When the user connects one or more folders, Desktop persists only the exact selected folders and updates file-watcher allowed roots dynamically without restarting the runtime. Existing `Documents\LazyMind` bindings keep their original virtual-root mapping.

`desktop/build/<target>/runtime` and `desktop/dist` are generated outputs. Each build recreates its target runtime; dependency downloads continue to use the normal Go, uv/pip, pnpm, Electron, and electron-builder user caches.
